# ChessV2
Chess Game on Java
Uses a 2D array of Cells to represent the board
Java Swing was used to implement the GUI

Currently supports 2 player version and against the computer.
Players can only play as White against the computer.
Screenshots of the game are available in the /screenshots folder.

I am currently in the process of developing the chess engine, 
since it currently exists in a very rudimentary form.

Ongoing goal: Build a chess engine good enough to beat myself!

TODO: 

Complete GUI by allowing user to select game mode 
(2 player or AI), difficulty level and teams

Complete Pawn promotion and castling movement logic. 
Start working on en passant



Note: The app is still in development, but feel free to test it out
